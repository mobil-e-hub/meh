## Communication via MQTT/EventGrid
### MQTT Broker
- Ensure that Mosquitto broker is running on the InES server
- Ensure that Mosquitto broker can be reached at ines-gpu-01.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/meh/mqtt (port 443)
- Test connection with an online MQTT client (e.g. http://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/) and document how to set up a connection
- Test and document the following use case: Subscribe to a topic from an online MQTT client and publish a message on this topic via a second online MQTT client -> It should be received by the first client

### Message Forwarder between MQTT and EventGrid
- Ensure that the mqtt module is running on the InES server (and is restarted when crashing)
- Test and document the following use case: Subscribe to a topic from an online MQTT client and send a message from EventGrid (for now: from Postman) to our endpoint -> It should be received by the client

### Integration of MQTT broker and sim/viz/opt modules

## Testing and Logging of Use Cases
- Define and document a simple scenario with a sequence of actions which should be executed via the visualization interface
- Implement a logging component which can receive all relevant events (via MQTT) and store them somewhere as a json file
